Anthony Sansone COM530 Project 1
================================

Status of Project
-----------------

After some clarification from Karl, I created both my resume and portfolio piece.

I validated both HTML pages against the [W3 HTML Validator](http://validator.w3.org/check) and the [W3 CSS Validator](http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator). All passed without error.

I experimented with some more advanced techniques to see what I could figure out.

Issues with the Project
-----------------------

I ran into an issue with the <link> tag attribute order with Chrome, which I used to test the pages. At home, I prefer it and had little problem other than it needed the media attribute to come last in order on the tag.

I also did not understand the portfolio part of the project. After asking Karl, I threw together an example from my current employer.

Finally, I did have some issues with styles, but I just experimented until it finally looked how I wanted.
